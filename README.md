# Student-Alcohol-Consumption [PL]

//original version of this project is polish

//translation in english is in progress


Goal: It is a statistical project based on testing different kinds of hypothesis based on data about student alcohol consumption. Main questions were:

1. Do students of GP and MS schools differ in the number of past academic failures? (using the Student's t-test method for independent samples,
2. Which of the ratings is higher - in the first or second period? (using the Student's t-test method for dependent samples),
3. Does the level of education of the student's mother affect the final grade? (one-way analysis of variance - anova in a between-group design),
4. Do the number of people in the student's family and the type of place of residence affect the final grade? (two-way analysis of variance - between-group analysis),
5. Is school absence related to age? (Pearson's r correlation analysis),
6. Can the final grade be predicted based on gender, number of absences from school and age? (linear regression analysis)
   
   

Technologies used: pandas, numpy & pinouin; matplotlib & seaborn for data visualisation.
